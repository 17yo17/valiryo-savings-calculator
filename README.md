ðŸ“Š How to Update Utility Rate Data
The location-based utility data is stored in a simple, easy-to-edit file. This allows anyone to add new locations or update existing rates without touching the main application code.

In the repository, navigate to the rates.json file.

Click the pencil icon (Edit this file) in the top right.

To add a new location, add a new key-value pair following the existing JSON format. The key should be a unique identifier. For example:

"au_sydney": { "elec": 0.21, "water": 0.0025, "currency": "$" }


To update an existing rate, simply change the elec or water value for the desired location.

Click "Commit changes" at the bottom of the page. The live calculator will now use the updated data.
